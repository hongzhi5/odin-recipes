    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In the humid weather of China's Sichuan province, locals know how to deal: a round of hot pot that simultaneously burns and numbs the tongue.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, Sichuan hot pot is made with caiziyou (roasted rapeseed oil), which imparts a lovely vegetal, toasty aroma. If you can't find it, you can substitute with peanut oil or another vegetable oil. Though I recommend using dried Sichuan chiles such as chaotian (often called "facing heaven" in English) or er jing tiao for their unparalleled fragrance, they are also more difficult to find in the U.S. The tianjin, or tien tsin, pepper is much more common at Chinese or Asian supermarkets in the U.S. and can definitely do the trick, but in my experience, they are not quite as aromatic and are also a bit spicier.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hot Pot Base</li>
            <li>2 cups (50 grams) dried Sichuan chile peppers</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To a small saucepot, add 1½ cups of the dried chile peppers. Pour in enough water to completely cover the peppers. Turn the heat to high and bring it to a boil. Let it boil for 20 minutes. Drain the chiles, then chop or pulse in a food processor into a rough paste. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the whole green Sichuan peppercorns. In a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, grind the remaining green peppercorns, the red peppercorns, cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves, star anise, cumin, fennel, and cloves until they are coarsely ground. Pour the ground spices into a small bowl and cover with ½ cup of the cooking wine. Let this mixture steep for 30 minutes while you prepare the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a wide, shallow soup pot over medium heat, add the oil and beef tallow (if using), and heat it to a gentle simmer. Add the finely chopped scallions, ginger, garlic, and lemongrass and cook until fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add the chopped chiles, doubanjiang, douchi, and chile flakes. Stir to combine and let it gently cook on low heat for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the ground spices from Step 1 to the pot, along with their soaking liquid. Add the rock sugar. Stir to combine and let the mixture gently simmer over low for another 10 to 15 minutes, allowing some of the liquid to cook off. Pour in 5 cups of stock and bring the soup to a boil. Once it boils, reduce the heat to low and let the broth continue to simmer for 10 more minutes. Turn off the heat, and let the broth steep for at least 30 minutes while you prepare the dunking ingredients. If preparing in advance, let the broth cool before transferring to an airtight container and placing in the fridge.</li>
            <li>When it's time to eat, use a slotted spoon to remove the solid sediments from the pot. Add in the remaining 2 tablespoons of whole green Sichuan peppercorns, remaining dried chiles, scallion segments, bouillon cube, and salt to taste. Place the pot on a portable electric stove on the dining table, and turn the heat to high. While you wait for the broth to come to a gentle boil, diners can mix their own dipping sauces; I start with a 1:1 ratio of sesame oil to garlic, then add from there to taste. Once the broth boils, reduce the heat to low or medium-low. Dunk ingredients into the broth until cooked through. Meats and seafood cook quickly, so keep an eye on them to avoid overcooking. Use chopsticks or a slotted ladle to retrieve the ingredients, then dip them in the sauce before eating. If the broth starts to run low, top it off with more stock.</li>
